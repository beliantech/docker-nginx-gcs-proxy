# gcs-spa-proxy
A Docker image for running Nginx as a proxy for Google Cloud Storage, with caching and SPA features.

## Usage

No public image available at the moment. Fork away!

To run locally:
```bash
docker build -t gcs-spa-proxy .
docker run --rm -e "GCS_BUCKET=gcs-bucket-name" -e "REDIRECT_404_TO_INDEX=true" -p 9191:8080 --expose 8080 gcs-spa-proxy
```

NGINX is then accessible via localhost:9191
